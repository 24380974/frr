The multithreading in lib/thread.[ch] was not completely done, in fact I was
aware of a race condition when a quagga-thread/event is running while another
system-thread tries to delete that specific quagga-thread/event.

I'm not quite sure where exactly it was, I think it was in rescheduling itself
to run versus the incoming delete (or something like that).  I remember my
takeway was "shit, I need to change the design again", and I think it was
indeed a rather annoying problem, but I don't remember the details :(
